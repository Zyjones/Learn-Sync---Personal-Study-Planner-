### Explanation:
- Each day is structured with two 30-minute study sessions, allowing for focused learning and practice.
- Resources are specified for each activity to guide the student in their studies.
- The plan incorporates a mix of theoretical review and practical application to reinforce learning through spaced repetition and retrieval practice.
