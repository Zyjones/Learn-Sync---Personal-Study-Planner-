Students should focus on understanding the assignment requirements and ensuring they address all checkpoints.\\n  - **Weakpoint 2**: Need to improve the ability to provide constructive feedback. This includes learning how to identify specific areas of improvement in code or analysis.\\n\\n- **Student 3 (Moderate)**:\\n  - **Weakpoint 1**: Need to identify and explain minor errors in detail. Students should practice articulating specific issues in their work.\\n  - **Weakpoint 2**: Understanding the importance of meeting all requirements. Review the assignment prompt to ensure all aspects are covered.\\n\\n- **Student 4 (Vague)**:\\n  - **Weakpoint 1**: Similar to Student 2, there is a need for more specific feedback.

Those with moderate feedback should work on articulating specific errors and ensuring all requirements are met. Expansive feedback indicates a strong understanding, and no weakpoints are identified for those students.'"
