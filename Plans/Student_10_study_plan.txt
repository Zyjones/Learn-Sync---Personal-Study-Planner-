Here's a structured 7-day study plan for Student 1, incorporating the feedback and resources provided. Each day includes specific tasks related to the weakpoints identified, broken into 30-minute sessions with breaks in between. The plan follows the principles of SMART goals, spaced repetition, and retrieval practice.
