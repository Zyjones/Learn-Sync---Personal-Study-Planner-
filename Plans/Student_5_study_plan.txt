### Explanation:
- Each day is structured with specific goals aligned with the weakpoints identified in the feedback.
- Time blocks are divided into 30-minute study sessions with 5-minute breaks to enhance focus and retention.
- Resources are specified for each session to guide the student in their study.
- Reflection prompts at the end of each day encourage the student to think critically about their learning and identify areas for further improvement.
