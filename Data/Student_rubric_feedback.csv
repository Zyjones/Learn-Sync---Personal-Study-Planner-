Student_4,Functionality,Code completes with a few simple errors that does not reflect a major bug in the code (i.e. it could be easily solvable).,25,12,60,"Your SQL code runs overall, but a few minor issues should be addressed. For example, you missed some join statements.These are small fixes and don’t indicate a major bug. Queries are well-structured and stylistically strong. The analysis includes appropriate tests, metrics, and clear visuals, showing solid reasoning. Be sure to submit all checkpoints on time to stay fully on track."

Student_5,Functionality,Code completes without errors,25,18,77,"Your submission was complete and code executed, but I noticed areas where optimization was missing (e.g., nested loops that could be replaced with vectorized operations). Style was acceptable, but avoid hardcoding values in your queries. Analysis lacked depth — metrics alone are not enough; explain what they mean in context. For example, when accuracy dropped by 5%, what might explain that change? Including interpretations will strengthen your analytical narrative."
