"Functionality: Code should perform the expected tasks without errors or silent failures. That means the code should completely run from beginning to end without stopping due to some exception. If applicable, erroneous data should be handled gracefully.",Code completes without errors,Code completes with a few simple errors that does not reflect a major bug in the code (i.e. it could be easily solvable).,Code errors out.,25
"Correctness: Code fulfills the listed requirements (in addition to being functional).

Style: Code is written in a way that adheres to PEP8 standards or guidelines set forth by instructors. For example, imports should follow standard practice (e.g. pandas as pd), variable names should be properly capitalized and spelled, and class names are properly capitalized and spelled.",Code is stylistically correct and works as planned.,"There a few stylistic errors, but these could be corrected without a major code refactor or code fulfills most requirements, but not all.",Code does not abide by any stylistic principles or does not satisfy preconditions.,25
"Analytical Detail: If applicable, is visual analysis of the data necessary and reasonable? Fellow must demonstrate not only technical ability in generating analysis but also the ability to describe their reasoning for said analysis. For instance, do we include the necessary statistical tests, model measurements, and visual exploratory data analysis which can provide background context and insight into performance?

These can include things like ANOVA, measures of central tendency, heatmaps, bar graphs, model metrics, and so on.","Analysis includes appropriate statistical tests, model performance metrics, and clear visual exploratory data analysis.",Analysis includes some visualizations or metrics but lacks depth or completeness.,"Analysis is missing, incorrect, or purely descriptive without analytical reasoning.",25
