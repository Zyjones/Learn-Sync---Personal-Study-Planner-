### Explanation:
- **SMART Goals**: Each session has a specific task aimed at improving a particular weak point.
- **Spaced Repetition**: The plan revisits concepts throughout the week to reinforce learning.
- **Retrieval Practice**: Each session encourages the student to apply what they've learned, enhancing retention.
- **Breaks**: Short breaks are included to help maintain focus and prevent burnout. 

This structured approach will help Student 1 effectively address their weak points and improve their skills in SQL, data analysis, and visualization.
